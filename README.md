# Unity 3D - 2d Character Platform Framework
This is a course I completed over at Lynda.com that focused on setting up a Platform 2D Character using behavior driven scripts. 
All of the functionality is completely modular and expandable in a way that is extremely straight forward once you understand how the imputs are setup.
This is absolutely a structure of organization I will be using in the future and am looking forward to challenges like Ludum Dare and other Game Jams to put it to the test.

I was so impressed with the course and the Instructor, Jesse Freeman, that I decided to knock out the rest of his courses. The course itself was well organized,
easy to follow, yet deep in content. Having taken many online courses and consumed many a Unity book, I will say this course is amoung the best for starting to
understand what good structure for a project looks like.
